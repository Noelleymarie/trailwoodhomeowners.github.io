  <h1>Trailwood HOA Board of Directors Blog</h1>
  <p>
    Thanks for looking at our weblog! This blog is used to share information
    written by members of the Board of Directors and HOA members in order to
    communicate things of a less ephemeral nature than we can share on Facebook,
    where things are lost quickly.
  </p>
  <p>
    If something becomes important enough or sticky enough, we’ll probably add
    it to a more permanent part of the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’d like to request a blog topic, or even have a blog post you’d like
    to see, please write to any of our board members.
