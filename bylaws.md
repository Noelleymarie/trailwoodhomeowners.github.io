    continuing lien upon the property against which each such assessment is
    made. Each such assessment, together with interest, costs, and reasonable

    successors in title unless expressly assumed by them.

    assessment for the previous year without a vote of the membership.
    
    From and after January 1 of the year immediately following the
    conveyance of the first lot to an Owner, the maximum annual assessment
    may be increased above five (5%) percent by a vote of two-thirds (2/3) of
    each class of members who are voting in person or by proxy, at a meeting
    duly called for this purpose.

4. Special Assessments for Capital Improvements. In addition to the annual
    assessments authorized above, the Association may levy, in any assessment
    year, a special assessment applicable to that year only for the purpose
    of defraying, in whole or in part, the cost of any construction,
    reconstruction, repair or replacement of a capital improvement upon the
    Common Area, including fixtures and personal property related thereto,
    provided that any such assessment shall have the assent of two-thirds
    (2/3) of the votes of each class of members who are voting in person or
    by proxy at a meeting duly called for this purpose.

5. Notice and Quorum for Actions Authorized Under Section 3 and 4.
    Written notice of any meeting called for the purpose of taking any
    action authorized under Section 3 or 4 shall be sent to all members not
    less than 30 days nor more than 60 days in advance of the meeting. At the
    first such meeting called, the presence of members or of proxies entitled
    to cast sixty (60%) percent of all the votes of each class of membership
    shall constitute a quorum. If the required quorum is not present, another
    meeting may be called subject to the same notice requirement, and the
    required quorum at the subsequent meeting shall be one-half (1/2) of the
    required quorum at the preceding meeting. No subsequent meeting shall be
    held more than 60 days following the preceding meeting.

6. Uniform Rate of Assessment. Both annual and special assessments must be
    fixed at a uniform rate within each membership class for all lots and may
    be collected on a monthly basis.

7. Date of Commencement of Annual Assessments: Due Dates. The annual
    assessments provided for herein shall commence as to all lots on the
    first day of the month following the conveyance of the Common Area. The
    first annual assessment shall be adjusted according to the number of
    months remaining in the calendar year. The Board of Directors shall fix
    the amount of the annual assessment against each lot at least thirty (30)
    days in advance of each annual assessment period. Written notice of the
    annual assessment shall be sent to every Owner subject thereto. The due
    dates shall be established by the Board of Directors. The Association
    shall, upon demand, and for a reasonable charge, furnish a certificate
    signed by an officer of the Association setting forth whether the
    assessments on a specified lot have been paid. A properly executed
    certificate of the Association as to the status of assessments on a lot
    is binding upon the Association as of the date of its issuance.

8. Effect of Nonpayment of Assessments: Remedies of the Association. Any
    assessment not paid within thirty (30) days after the due date shall bear
    interest from the due date at the rate of six (6%) percent per annum. The
    Association may bring an action at law against the owner personally
    obligated to pay the same, or foreclose the lien against the property. No
    owner may waive or otherwise escape liability for the assessments
    provided for herein by non-use of the Common Area or abandonment of his
    lot.

9. Exempt Property. All Common Area and all other property exempt from
    taxation by state or local governments and dedicated for public use shall
    be exempt from the assessments, charge and lien created herein.

10. Subordination of the Lien to Mortgages. The lien of the assessments
    provided for herein shall be subordinate to the lien of any first
    mortgage. Sale or transfer of any lot shall not affect the assessment
    lien. However, the sale or transfer of any lot pursuant to mortgage
    foreclosure or any proceeding in lieu thereof shall extinguish the lien
    of such assessments as to payments which became due prior to such sale or
    transfer. No sale or transfer shall relieve such lot from liability for
    any assessments thereafter becoming due or from the lien' thereof.
