README for Trailwood GitHub Pages
=================================

This repository consists of the Trailwood Homeowners Association homepages.

For ease of maintenance by multiple contributors, these pages take advantage of
GitHub’s Jekyll integration. Therefor it is necessary to be slightly familiar
with Jekyll and GitHub’s implementation of Jekyll in order to make changes to
our sites.

About Github Pages
------------------

The website is served from files located in:

  - [https://github.com/trailwoodhomeowners/trailwoodhomeowners.github.io][2].
  
It can be reached from either of the following:

  - [http://www.trailwoodhomeowners.org][3], or
  - [https://trailwoodhomeowners.github.io][4].
  
The latter is the standard means of accessing the project page, however the
former works because we've set up a domain name and configured GitHub to use the
domain name via the `CNAME` file in the repository.


Local Server
